      <description>ngolimi &amp;hellip; is Zulu for through language. And what would be more logical for an Iranian computational linguist and a German language technology manager, both living in French-speaking Switzerland, than to choose a Zulu name for their nonprofit project?
     What we do Language technology consultancy for NGOs, large and small Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the ngo in ngolimi ? From strategy to implementation — we want to help you communicate with your audiences in the languages they actually speak.</description>

      <description>Open-source dictionary webapp Glossaries are the foundation of any &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; language work and multilingual dictionaries the most essential support for multilingual communication.
Yet while there are many products and context-specific tools to create and manage terminology, the solutions generally available to share terminology publicly are scarce and in our view, not optimized for today&amp;rsquo;s online experience.
This is the gap the ngolimi open-source dictionary webapp is meant to address. It offers any organization or individual who wants to share their terminology over the internet a framework to do so autonomously.</description>

      <description>Swiss government COVID-19 hackathon challenge: Speak the Truth ngolimi has been invited to take part in the Swiss government&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 online hackathon. We do so both as participants and challenge owner.
Our challenge: &amp;ldquo;Speak the Truth&amp;rdquo; Speakers of other languages than German, French, Italian and English, and the functionally illiterate (15% of Swiss adults) are cut from official COVID-19 information and therefore particularly vulnerable to the “infodemic” spreading on social media (eg.</description>
