## What we do
### Showcase best language technology practices
It's hard to stay up to date with the progress in language technology. We show how the pieces can be put together to support communication strategies that take full advantage of the world's linguistic diversity.

### Language technology consultancy for NGOs, large and small
Maybe that's the ngo in _ngolimi_ ?

From strategy to implementation â€” we want to help you communicate with your audiences in the languages they actually speak.
