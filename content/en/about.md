## What we do
### Language technology consultancy for NGOs, large and small
Maybe that's the _ngo_ in _ngolimi_ ?
From strategy to implementation â€” we want to help you communicate with your audiences in the languages they actually speak.

### Showcase best practices in language technology
It's hard to stay up to date with the progress in language technology. We show how the pieces can be put together to support communication strategies that take full advantage of the world's linguistic diversity.
