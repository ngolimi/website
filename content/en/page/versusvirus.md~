# Swiss government COVID-19 hackathon challenge: Speak the Truth

ngolimi has been invited to take part in the Swiss government's COVID-19 online hackathon. We do so both as participants and challenge owner.

## Our challenge: "Speak the Truth" 

Speakers of other languages than German, French, Italian and English, and the functionally illiterate (15% of Swiss adults) are cut from official COVID-19 information and therefore particularly vulnerable to the “infodemic” spreading on social media (eg. Whatsapp audio messages). Therefore, providers of authoritative COVID-19 information cannot reach a particularly vulnerable part of their target audience.	

A simple system where speakers of a language can translate and/or record the information and then directly share it on social media. The message will maintain a "backlink" so that it can be verified, and that misuse can be flagged.
